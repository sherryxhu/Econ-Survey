# Econ-Survey

### Fall 2019 Folder: 
* ECON101 Pre Survey - Fullenkamp (A).csv 
* ECON101 Post Survey - Fullenkamp (NA).csv 

### Spring 2020 Folder: 
* ECON201 Pre Survey - Abdulkadiroglu (A).csv
* ECON201 Post Survey - Abdulkadiroglu (A).csv
* ECON101 EOS Survey - Leachman (A).csv

### Notes: 
* The two surveys under Fullenkamp were conducted on the same batch of students (same for the two Abdulkadiroglu surveys).
* The survey under Leachman was only conducted at the end of the semester of Spring 2020. No pre survey was conducted that semester. 
* The two backup csvs in the old files folder are the same csv/survey (ECON101 Pre Survey - Fullenkamp). Not sure if the cleaned files are cleaned all the way yet but they are the result of running cleaningScript.R on the csvs in this folder.
